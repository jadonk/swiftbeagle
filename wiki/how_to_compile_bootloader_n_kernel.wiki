#summary How to compile our modified code

If you don't want to compile from source, use the compiled binaries from the [http://code.google.com/p/swiftbeagle/downloads/list download page].

== signGP ==

Enter the directory and 

{{{
gcc signGP.c -o signGP
}}}

You will need signGP to sign the x-load.bin.

== x-loader ==

Enter the directory and 

{{{
$ make omap3530beagle_config
$ make 
$ ./signGP x-load.bin
}}}

x-load.bin.ift will be generated. The difference between x-load.bin and x-load.bin.ift is the later has an additional 8-byte header to tell how large x-load.bin is.
